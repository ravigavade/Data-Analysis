For my first data analysis project, I explored bike sales data to gain valuable insights into customer preferences and trends. The project involved cleaning and organizing raw data to ensure accuracy and reliability for analysis. Leveraging data visualization techniques, I created an interactive dashboard to highlight key metrics such as sales performance, customer demographics, and product popularity. This project provided me with a hands-on understanding of the data analysis workflow, from preprocessing to presenting actionable insights in a clear and visually engaging format.
